/**
 * Thread context.
 * <p>
 * The thread context is used by Catalyst to determine the correct thread on which to execute asynchronous callbacks.
 * All threads created within Catalyst must be instances of {@link CatalystThread}. Once
 * a thread has been created, the context is stored in the thread object via
 * {@link CatalystThread#setContext(Context)}. This means there is a one-to-one relationship
 * between a context and a thread. That is, a context is representative of a thread and provides an interface for firing
 * events on that thread.
 * <p>
 * In addition to serving as an {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor}, the context also provides thread-local storage
 * for {@link Serializer} serializer instances. All serialization that takes place within a
 * {@link CatalystThread} should use the context {@link #serializer()}.
 * <p>
 * Components of the framework that provide custom threads should use {@link CatalystThreadFactory}
 * to allocate new threads and provide a custom {@link Context} implementation.
