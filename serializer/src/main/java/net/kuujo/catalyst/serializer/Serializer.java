/**
 * Copycat serializer.
 * <p>
 * This class provides an interface for efficient serialization of Java objects. Serialization is performed by
 * {@link TypeSerializer} instances. Objects that can be serialized by {@link Serializer} must be registered. When objects
 * are serialized, Copycat will write the object's type as an 16-bit unsigned integer. When reading objects, the
 * 16-bit identifier is used to construct a new object.
 * <p>
 * Serializable objects must either provide a {@link TypeSerializer}. implement {@link CatalystSerializable}, or implement
 * {@link java.io.Externalizable}. For efficiency, serializable objects may implement {@link net.kuujo.catalyst.util.ReferenceCounted}
 * or provide a {@link PooledSerializer} that reuses objects during deserialization.
 * Copycat will automatically deserialize {@link net.kuujo.catalyst.util.ReferenceCounted} types using an object pool.
 * <p>
 * Serialization via this class is not thread safe.
